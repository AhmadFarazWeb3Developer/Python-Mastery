# ðŸ“˜ Part E: Critical Thinking Questions

### 1. Generalizability from Urban Data

The dataset is urban-only, which can lead to **bias** in the model. It may perform poorly on rural populations with different credit behavior, income, and demographics.

**Recommendation**: Gather data from diverse locations for better generalization.

### 2. Dominating Feature (e.g., Credit_History)

If a feature dominates, it's likely very informative. You **should not remove** it blindly. Instead:

- Investigate its importance
- Use regularization if overfitting occurs
- Try models both with and without to compare

---

### 3. Real-Time Prediction for New Applicants

To handle real-time inputs:

- Apply **same label encoding** used during training
- Apply **same scaler** (e.g., `StandardScaler`)
- Ensure **feature order and structure** are identical

Use `joblib` or `pickle` to store preprocessing objects.

### 4. When Does ANN Outperform Traditional Models?

Neural networks perform best with:

- Large data
- Complex patterns and non-linear relationships
- Less structured data (images, text)

**Detect Overfitting**:

- High training but low validation accuracy
- Diverging loss curves
- Use dropout, early stopping, and batch normalization
