# # 5. (1 point) Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictio-
# # nary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is
# # in , its approximate population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary
# # should be something like country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all
# # of the information you have stored about it.
