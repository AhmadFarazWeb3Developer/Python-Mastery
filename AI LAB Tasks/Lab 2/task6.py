# 6. (1 point) A company wants to keep track of daily tasks assigned to its employees. Each employee
# is assigned multiple tasks, and you are required to develop a Python program to manage this
# system.
# 1. Create a list where each element is a tuple containing the employee‚Äôs name and a list of
# their assigned tasks.
# 2. Implement a function that allows a manager to add a new task for an employee.
# 3. Implement a function that removes a completed task.
# 4. If an employee has more than 5 tasks, display a warning message.
# 5. Print all employees and their remaining tasks at the end.

# Function to add a new task for an employee
def add_new_task(employee_name, task, employees):
    for employee in employees:
        if employee[0] == employee_name:
            if len(employee[1]) >= 5:  # Warning if tasks exceed 5
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: {employee_name} has too many tasks!")
            employee[1].append(task)
            return
    print(f"Employee '{employee_name}' not found!")

# Function to remove a completed task

    for employee in employees:
        if employee[0] == employee_name:
            if task in employee[1]:
                employee[1].remove(task)
            else:

            return
